## About

Movement Plus is a mod that adds a couple of additional movement options, primarily midair jumps and coyote time. All of this mods features can be configured to fit your preferences.

Features:

* Adjust player jump height
* Multi Jumps
* Coyote Time
* Adjustable Step Height
* ... more to come!

Most of these features are disabled by default must be enabled in the server config. The server config can be found the world save folder.
I recommend using Configured if you would like to have a nice interface for configuring this mod's settings.

## What is Coyote Time

Coyote time is a short time frame during which the player can jump even if they technically already ran of the edge of the black. It's a small grace period if you mess up your jump so to say.

But it's also useful if you try to go down stairs and jump off them or situations like that where vanilla Minecraft's jump mechanics are usually a pain in the bun.

The default length of coyote time in this mod is 3 ticks or a bit more than a tenth of a second. So it's there but shouldn't be too noticeable.

## Planned Features

* Adjustable base movement speed
* Adjustable base swimming speed
* Sharking
* Dashing + Dodging
